Shared is a photo sharing site which allows users to create an account, post their pictures with comments, follow other users as well as like and comment on other users posts.

I used the Moments Walkthrough on Code Institute as the starting point for this app and developed from there.

Functionality that exists on the site:

Create Account

Log In / Out

Create posts with image upload and caption

Retrieve posts via their own profile

Edit those posts after posting

Delete those posts after posting

Comment on their own/other users posts

Like other users posts

Follow other users

Edit their profile including bio/profile image/username/password

Delete their profile if they no longer which to use the site

The site has multiple useable pages within it:

Home page: shows all posts by all users where the user is signed in or not

Sign in page: allows existing users to sign in

Register page: allowes new users to join the site

Once Signed in a user will then see:
Home - as described above

Feed - posts from users that they are following

Liked - posts that the user has liked

Commented - posts that the user has commented on

Activity - this is a list of the Users posts that have been commented on by other users

Sign Out - allows the user to sign out and re-directs them back to the home page

Your Profile - allows the user to see their own profile, with their own posts and allows them to edit their profile
