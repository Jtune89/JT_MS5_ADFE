Shared is a photo sharing site which allows users to create an account, post their pictures with comments, follow other users as well as like and comment on other users posts.

I used the Moments Walkthrough on Code Institute as the starting point for this app and developed from there.

Functionality that exists on the site:

Create Account
Log In / Out
Create posts with image upload and caption
Retrieve posts via their own profile
Edit those posts after posting
Delete those posts after posting
Comment on their own/other users posts
Like other users posts
Follow other users
Edit their profile including bio/profile image/username/password
Delete their profile if they no longer which to use the site

The site has multiple useable pages within it:

Home page: shows all posts by all users where the user is logged in or not
